# Jenkins-CICD-Project

This Jenkins pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment of a Flask application. It fetches the application code from a GitHub repository, installs dependencies, runs unit tests, and deploys to a staging environment.
Jenkins CI CD pipeline for flask application

Objective:
Set up a Jenkins pipeline that automates the testing and deployment of a simple Python web application.


Requirements:


1. Setup:

   - Install Jenkins on a virtual machine or use a cloud-based Jenkins service.

   - Configure Jenkins with Python and any necessary libraries.


2. Source Code:

  - Fork the provided Python web application repository on GitHub (provide a link to a sample Python web application repository).

  - Clone the forked repository into your Jenkins server.


3. Jenkins Pipeline:

   - Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your Python application repository.

   - Define a pipeline with the following stages:

     - Build: Install dependencies using pip.

     - Test: Run unit tests using a testing framework like pytest.

     - Deploy: If tests pass, deploy the application to a staging environment.


4. Triggers:

   - Configure the pipeline to trigger a new build whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.


5. Notifications:

   - Set up a notification system to alert via email when the build process fails or succeeds.


6. Documentation:

   - Document the pipeline process and any prerequisites needed for the setup in a README.md file in the repository.


7. Submission:

   - Provide the URL to the GitHub repository with the Jenkinsfile and updated README.md.

   - Include screenshots of the Jenkins pipeline showing the build, test, and deployment stages.
